By this action, you will provoke to develop a new version for CR-MP 0.3.7. 
I am now in a difficult financial situation, so I will be glad of any help.
If at least $ 200 is collected, I promise to update the trainer.  
I will fix all the bugs of the current version.  
I also adapt it for updated anti-cheats.  
In general, there will be a working version of the trainer
